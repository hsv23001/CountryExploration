# CountryExploration
As an interest project, I am collecting and combining available data by country, and looking to draw some insights into what impacts net migration, happiness index, and other factors.

I'll also applying some ML methods to see how predictive some of these factors are in determining net migration for a single year, or span of several years.

The data sources are as follows:
    - global info by country taken from 
    - religious composition data by country taken from Pew Research Center
    https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/feature/religious-composition-by-country-2010-2020/
        - available years: 2010 and 2020
    - "happy" scores taken from the World Happiness Report
    https://www.worldhappiness.report/data-sharing/
        - available years: all years 2012 to 2015
    - net migration data taken from World Bank Group
    https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.NETM
        - available years: all years 1960-2024
